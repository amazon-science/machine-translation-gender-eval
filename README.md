# MT-GenEval

This repository contains the data and code for the MT-GenEval benchmark, which evaluates gender translation accuracy on English -> {Arabic, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish}. 
The MT-GenEval benchmark was released in the EMNLP 2022 paper [MT-GenEval: A Counterfactual and Contextual Dataset for Evaluating Gender Accuracy in Machine Translation](https://www.amazon.science/publications/mt-geneval-a-counterfactual-and-contextual-dataset-for-evaluating-gender-accuracy-in-machine-translation) by Anna Currey, Maria Nadejde, Raghavendra Pappagari, Mia Mayer, Stanislas Lauly, Xing Niu, Benjamin Hsu, and Georgiana Dinu.

## Data
The data is originally sourced from Wikipedia. 
We include sentence-level development and test segments in `data/sentences/` and inter-sentence test segments in `data/context/`. 

## Compute accuracy
To compute accuracy, use `accuracy_metric.py` script. 
Example usage for English-Russian contextual test dataset is as follows
```
python3 accuracy_metric.py \
        --target_lang ru \
        --dataset contextual \
        --data_split test \
        --hyp PATH_FOR_YOUR_SYSTEM_TRANSLATIONS
```
Example usage for English-Russian counterfactual test dataset is as follows
```
python3 accuracy_metric.py \
        --target_lang ru \
        --dataset counterfactual \
        --data_split test \
        --hyp_masculine PATH_FOR_YOUR_SYSTEM_TRANSLATIONS_FOR_MASCULINE_SEGMENTS \
        --hyp_feminine PATH_FOR_YOUR_SYSTEM_TRANSLATIONS_FOR_FEMININE_SEGMENTS
```
