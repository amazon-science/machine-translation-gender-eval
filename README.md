# MT-GenEval
MT-GenEval is a benchmark dataset for evaluating gender accuracy in translation in two genders (female and male) from English into eight widely-spoken languages: Arabic (AR), French (FR), German (DE), Hindi (HI), Italian (IT), Portuguese (PT), Russian (RU), and Spanish (ES).

MT-GenEval complements existing benchmarks by providing realistic, gender-balanced, counterfactual data in eight language pairs where the gender of individuals is unambiguous in the input segment, including multi-sentence segments requiring inter-sentential gender agreement.
